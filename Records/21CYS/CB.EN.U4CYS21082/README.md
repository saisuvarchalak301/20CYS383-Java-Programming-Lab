#Project Description
Managing payments can be a challenging task for individuals and businesses alike.Keeping track of payment history, managing payment methods, and ensuring the security
of payment information can be time-consuming and complex. Therefore, there is a need for a payment management system that simplifies payment processing and management, while also ensuring security and reliability. A payment management system is essential for individuals and businesses to keep track of their payments, payment history, and payment methods. Without such a system, payment management can be cumbersome, leading to errors, payment delays, and other issues. Additionally, security is of utmost importance when it comes to payment management. A payment management system that ensures secure payment processing and protection of sensitive payment information is necessary to prevent fraud and protect the privacy of users. The payment management system should allow users to manage their accounts by changing their personal details and password securely. The system should ensure that user information is protected and not accessible by unauthorized personnel.The payment management system should allow users to register and login securely.The system should provide users with various payment options, such as credit/debit cards, net banking, UPI, etc. The payment details should be validated before processing to prevent payment errors. Additionally, the system should maintain a record of payment history, including the amount paid, date, and payment method used. The proposed solution is to design and implement a payment management system in Java that allows users to manage their payments, payment history, and payment methods securely and efficiently. The system should be designed using object-oriented programming principles, ensuring that it is modular and easy to maintain.
